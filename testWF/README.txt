Hi! This set of files are temporary. 

Launching this will give you two options:
1. Open cmd from the app: Closing the cmd window should allow you to view where all the relevant files are.
2. Translate jsontrans_SAP.json into Oracle format via jsontranslator.py and written to jsontrans_OUT.json

Will pick up where I left off after the 138 exam but the to-dos are:
- Take cmd-line args as input to adjust the input file
- Write code for SAP to NS, Oracle to SAP, Oracle to NS, NS to SAP, NS to Oracle
- Combine everything into one script that takes another argument which decides which translation mode to toggle
- Output the location of translated file
