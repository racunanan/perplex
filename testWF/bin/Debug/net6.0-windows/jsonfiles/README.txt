sap_PO_example.json is converted to oracle_PO_example.json as a
basis for the conversion from SAP to Oracle (note the key/value pairs)

The "stubs" key field contains parts that are present in one format
but not present in the other. Example: the "stubs" in
oracle_PO_example.json contains fields that are only present in the 
SAP format. This is for converting back to SAP from Oracle.
